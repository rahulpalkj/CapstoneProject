# CapstoneProject
Trained and tested several machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of penury

This project is part of the professional data science certification program from Microsoft
The detailed procedure and the steps carried out are presented in the report file.
Several regression machine learning algorithms are trained and tested for the training and testing dataset.
Out of the different tested algorithms, Random Forest Regression gave the highest cofficient of determinent.

I was among the top 50 in the leaderboard for this data driven competition at the time of publishing this repository.
This is a single person autonumous project, which I have completed in one and half days.

Thanks for reading my project.
